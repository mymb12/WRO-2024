## What does this robot do?
The highlight of our robot - is addressing the `issue of ice on the roads`.
Robot automates the process of breaking ice into cubes through cracking it and collecting to the specific section.

## Sencors
Robot consists of special type of sensors, namely: 

1. **Camera** :video_camera:

Camera detects the human/animal moves, which provides the safety for the environtment among the robot.

> [!IMPORTANT]

2. **Grinder Auger**

Grinder auger sellects the cubes of ice to clear the sapce around.

3. **Motor wheels** :red_car:

The wheels have independent axes. It makes the robot more flexible in the town. Also, the roughness of the wheels is enough for comfortable movement around the city.
